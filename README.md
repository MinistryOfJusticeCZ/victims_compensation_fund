# Victims compensation fund

This repository represents current state of running code for Victims Compensations Fund application.
This is Ruby on Rails application.

The document generator prototype is needed to generate some documents.

No more documentation is provided, as long as it is still in beta.
There is remake for this application planned and with that should be presented more documentation.
The existing one is only for internal purposes and not in really usable state.

We are sorry for any inconvenience, but you can reach with us for further information.
